This is a handful of examples of using [ServiceStack][] 
based on the [ServiceStack.Hello Tutorial][TUT].

The code illustrates the following:

- **TryServiceStack**: Running a web service alone (without a website)
- **SiteWithService**: Running a web service along side a website
- Accessing the service from the following clients:
  - **ConsoleServiceClient**: a console program
  - **SiteWithService**: the accompanied website (via an html form)
  - **GuiClient**: a cross-platform GUI
  - **iPadClient**: an iPad app

This code was built on a Mac with [MonoDevelop][]. Everything but the iPad app is cross-platform.  ([MonoTouch][] is necessary to build/deploy the iPad client.)
